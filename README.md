# GaAs Surface Damage-Ionback-bombardment

This code can be used to find QE decay and power density on photocathode surface.<br/>
Ion back bombardment on the cathode surface can sputter away NEA material from acthode surface. Static Sputtering can be calculated using SRIM Monte Carlo Simulation. <br/>
* Find QE map on the cathode surface<br/>
  * qe_map_nm.py can be used to find the Normalized QE on the cathode surface<br/>
* FInd Power Density on Cathode Surface<br/>
  * pw_density_v2.py can be used to find the Power Density on Cathode Surface<br/>

## Prerequisites:

* Python 3
* or Pycharm with Proper Packagages
* SRIM need to be installed for specific case of QE study. For Normalized Power density Estimation, SRIM is not required.
